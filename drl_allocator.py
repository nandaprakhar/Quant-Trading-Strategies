    """
    Determines asset allocation using a (simulated) DRL ensemble.

    In a real implementation, this function would take the current state of the market
    (e.g., prices, indicators of selected stocks) and use a trained DRL agent to output
    the optimal portfolio weights.

    For this project, we will simulate this by assigning equal weights to the selected stocks.

    Args:
        selected_tickers (list): The list of stocks selected by the ML model.
        data (pd.DataFrame): The full dataset of all stocks.
        current_date (str): The date for which to determine the allocation.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary with tickers as keys and their allocated weights as values.
